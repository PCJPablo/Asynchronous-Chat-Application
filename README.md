# Asynchronous-Chat-Application
First Assingment for my C# class. It is an asynchronous console chat application.

To use this application run one instance with the parameter -server and start another instance with no parameters. To type a
message hit "i" this will show the prompt ">>" which means you can type a message when you hit enter the other instance will 
receive the message.
